Chief Marketing Officer complain that The Germany branch recorded a churn rate of 32,44%, substantially exceeding the industry median of 19% for financial industry as reported by What’s the Average Churn Rate by Industry? indicating a critical need for targeted retention strategies.

## 🍦🍧🍪 Project Scope & Data Overview 🍪🍧🍦
The data, obtained from Kaggle, was processed and analyzed with Excel, Python, and Tableau tools. We are only focusing on data from Germany, which results in 2,509 rows after filtering. This analysis focuses only on 9 variables that are highly relevant to churn rate analysis. These variables are :

## 🍦🍧🍪 Project Goals 🍪🍧🍦

Here is the objectives below :

<img width="515" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80c29abb-f7e1-4610-97df-081392e2c2e5" />


## 🍦🍧🍪 Research Methodology 🍪🍧🍦
Here is the objectives below :

## 🍦🍧🍪 Female in the age range of 46-55 have a high churn from bank 🍪🍧🍦

Here is the objectives below :

## 🍦🍧🍪 More Stay Customers Than Churned Customers Across Tenure 🍪🍧🍦

Longer tenure is strongly correlated with higher customer retention, suggesting that customers who have been with the company longer are more loyal and less likely to churn.

Here is the objectives below :
<img width="428" height="211" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c78bbdbf-3a09-4785-99c3-a6c91e69db47" />


## 🍦🍧🍪 Customers who churn have a lower balance distribution compared to those who stay 🍪🍧🍦

Here is the objectives below :

<img width="667" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11463232-2e25-494f-915e-8db750aaf484" />

While churn customers have a slightly higher average balance, stay customers show more balance variety, especially with a higher number of outliers at the top end. 



## 🍦🍧🍪 Customers with no credit cards tend to have customer churn 🍪🍧🍦
Customers with credit cards are significantly more likely to stay, while those without credit cards are more likely to churn.

Here is the objectives below :

<img width="677" height="579" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd498ff-df68-4e34-bb6b-2e204f2e0612" />

## 🍦🍧🍪 Inactive members are much more likely to churn 🍪🍧🍦

Active customers are more likely to stay, while inactive customers have a higher churn rate. Encouraging inactive customers to become active could help reduce churn and improve retention. Here is the objectives below :

<img width="517" height="440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6987c65f-af4e-4f38-8079-9d43bce804da" />


## 🍦🍧🍪 Average estimated salary does not significantly influence customer churn 🍪🍧🍦

Customers with slightly higher salaries tend to stay, but salary alone is not a strong predictor of churn due to similar salary distributions. Other factors should be analyzed for better understanding of churn. Here is the objectives below :

<img width="780" height="581" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c726477b-1ad8-4bf2-beea-f4cfdb7372ce" />



## 🍦🍧🍪 There is no significant impact of credit score on customer churn 🍪🍧🍦
Both groups have overlapping distributions, indicating that other factors besides credit score also play a role in customer retention or churn. These variables are :

## 🍦🍧🍪 The number of products owned does not have a significant effect on customer churn 🍪🍧🍦

The number of products is a weak predictor of churn, with a correlation of -0.073 indicating a very weak negative relationship between product count and churn status. In other words, product ownership has little significant impact on whether a customer churns. These variables are :

## 🍦🍧🍪 There are four variables that strongly influence customer churn in the bank 🍪🍧🍦
Here is the objectives below :

## 🍦🍧🍪 We categorized the predicted churn probabilities into three distinct risk levels  🍪🍧🍦

The majority of customers (54.6%) are at low risk of churn, indicating good loyalty. However, 28.6% are at medium risk and 16.9% at high risk, requiring special attention.
Retention strategies should focus on high-risk customers and preventing medium-risk customers from churning to minimize overall churn.
